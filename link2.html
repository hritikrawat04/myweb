[Outline]
India Kawasaki Motors Pvt. Ltd. is a subsidiary of Kawasaki Motors Limited, Japan. The Indian journey of Kawasaki began in 2009 with the launch of Ninja 650 and Ninja 250.

On 1st July 2010, India Kawasaki Motors Pvt. Ltd. (IKM) was incorporated to enter the Indian Super Bike Market. Further from July 2013, IKM started assembly of Z250, Ninja 300, Ninja 650, ER-6N, and Versys 650 motorcycles at its plant located in the premises of its Indian partner, while the functions such as marketing, sales and after-sales services were taken care by Kawasaki’s Indian partner.

Ninja ZX-14R, Ninja ZX-10R, Ninja 1000, Z1000, Z800 through its own dealers located in major cities in India. Off-Road Bikes such as KLX110, KLX140 were also introduced in Indian market.

In the plant, currently Ninja 300, Ninja 400, Ninja 650, Z650, Versys 650, Vulcan S, Ninja ZX-6R, Ninja 1000, Ninja ZX-10R, and Versys 1000 are assembled.
Currently, IKM sells 26 models in its 42 dealerships across the country.
